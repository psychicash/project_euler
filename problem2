#final solution
#defines two arrays to start

fib_arr = [1, 0]     #the begining of the sequence
fib_even = []        #repository for the even terms


#code for the Fibonacci sequence itself
#the 4 million here could be switched to
#number to discover those terms

while fib_arr[0] < 4000000
       move = fib_arr[0] + fib_arr[1]
       fib_arr.unshift move
end

#this selects the even terms in the Fibonacci array and
#pushes them to the even repository so the math below
#has a reference to add from
fib_arr.each do |x|
    if x % 2 == 0
        fib_even << x
    else
    end
end

#everything below here is just text and displaying the values of the arrays until the last line that finally
#seperates all the even numbers and adds them.
puts "The Fibonacci sequence for all terms less than 4,000,000 is this:"
